Parts of vbFRET were built on or borrow directly from the codes of others, including those of Matt Beal; Chris Bishop and Ian Nabney; and Emtiyaz Khan and Kevin Murphy.

The GUI was designed using tutorial code from the blinkdagger matlab blog (http://blinkdagger.com/).

From Murphy/Khan and Beal:
--------------------------
Much of the function vbFRET_VBEM.m comes from code found in VBEMGMM by Emtiyaz Khan and Kevin Murphy (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/VBEMGMM/index.html) and vbhmm by Matt Beal(http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/software.html).

From Beal:
---------------------
1. The function forwbackFRET.m was created using modified from code found in vbhmm.
2. The function dirrnd.m was borrowed from vbhmm without modification.

From Nabney/Bishop:
-----------------------
The following functions were borrowed without modification from netlab, by Chris Bishop and Ian Nabney (http://www.ncrg.aston.ac.uk/netlab/index.php):

1. consist.m
2. dist2.m
3. gauss.m
4. gmm.m
5. gmmactiv.m
6. gmmem.m
7. gmmpost.m
8. gmmprob.m
9. kmeans.m

The function vbfret_gmminit.m was created using modified code found in netlab.
